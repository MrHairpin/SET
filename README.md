# Notes for Social Engineering Toolkit

The Social-Engineering Toolkit (SET) is a python-driven suite of custom tools which solely focuses
on attacking the human element of penetration testing. Its main purpose is to augment and simulate
social-engineering attacks and allow the tester to effectively test how a targeted attack may succeed.
Social-Engineering toolkit is available on Backtrack like on Kali Linux, backbox, blackbuntu,
Gnacktrack and other Linux distribution that are used for penetration testing.
